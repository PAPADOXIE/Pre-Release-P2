# Pre-Release-P2
An advanced version of the Alevels May/June 2019 Paper 2 Pre Release.
Probably won't interest anyone other than highschool student level programmers

There are a few bugs which I might fix later. 

This is here mostly just for myself but I made it public so if anyone wants to read the code they can.
